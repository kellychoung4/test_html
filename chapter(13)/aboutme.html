<h3> Hello! </h3>

<p class="first">I'm Kelly, an aspiring web developer with a background in computer science and formal training in interior design. After studying computer science years ago, I've recently returned to the tech world with a fresh perspective and a passion for creating interactive, user-friendly websites.</p>
<p class="second">My design background helps me approach web development with an eye for layout, color, and balance â€” while my technical side loves problem-solving and bringing ideas to life through code. My goal is to build my own website completely from scratch and keep expanding my skills in front-end and full-stack development.</p>
<p class="third">Outside of coding, I enjoy watercolor painting and often make handmade bookmarks from my artwork, which I donate to the local library. It's a small way to share creativity and brighten someone's day.</p>
