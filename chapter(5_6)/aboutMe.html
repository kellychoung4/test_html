    <h2>Places I have visited</h2>

    Here are some images from when I traveled the world. These were my top three favorite places. The food was amazing! <!-- store the images you want to use in a folder called "images" - you will need to use an <img href=""/> tag to place them in your document  -->
    <ol> 
        <li>Honolulu</li>
        <br/>
        <img src="images/cosmin-serban-honolulu-unsplash.jpg" alt = "Haleakala Mountain - Photo by Cosmin Serban on Upsplash" width = "70%"><br/><br/>
        <li>Haleakala National Park</li>
        <br/>
        <img src="images/haleakala.jpg" alt = "Photo of Haleakala National Park" width = "70%"> <br/><br/>
        <li>Jeju Island in Korea</li>
        <br/>

    <h2>Favorite Animals</h2>

    I definitely consider myself a cat person. I love dogs too, but I get along better with cats. Here are 2 images of my favorite animals. 
    <br/><br/>
        <figure>
        <img src = "images/cat1.jpg" alt = "Photo of my friend Jess's cat" width ="50%">
        <figcaption>He is still in a dream... zzzzz</figcaption>
        <br/><br/>

        <img src = "images/cat2.jpg" alt="Photo of my friend's cat" width = "50%">
        <br>
        <figcaption>This is my friends's cat. He had a rough time doing nothing all day!</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <!-- change this to fit the animal you like and add at least ONE <figure> and <figcaption> to one of the images, as seen on page 120. You can use that EXACT syntax -->

    <h2 >Favorite Movie</h2>

    Here is a picture of my favorite movie. If you click on it, it will take you to my About Me page. Why? Well... because why not? ; <!-- wrap your <img> tag with an <a> tag like this: <a href=""> <img src="" alt=""> </a> -->
    <br/>
    <a href="aboutMe.html"><img src="images/spiritedAway.jpeg" alt="Photo of my favorite movie, Spirited Away by Studio Ghibli"></a><br/>
