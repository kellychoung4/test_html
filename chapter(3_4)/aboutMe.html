    <hr>
    <p>Hi, I'm Kelly. <br />
        Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
        I'm here to share what I love like music, anime, designs and more. 
        This is my space where I get to showcase the things that inspire me and 
        the things I've created along the way. 
    </p>
    <p>I'm a huge fan of Nintendo game <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>. I was so into 
       it for a while, and I even had a turtleneck a couple years ago. The character 
       design, music, customization, seasonal mini-games and events... I can't stop loving 
       <em>Animal Crossing</em>.
