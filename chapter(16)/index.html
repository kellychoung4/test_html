        <p> There are so many anime out there, but some are just special. They stick in your mind and stay in your heart even after you finish them. They make you feel something real. These are the shows that made people fall in love with anime in the first place. If you want to understand why anime is such a big deal, these are the ones you should watch at least once in your life. They are fun, emotional, inspiring, and sometimes a little weird, but in the best way. </p>
