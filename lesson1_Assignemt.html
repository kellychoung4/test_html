    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. 
        And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
<!-- add a long line here -->

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings)
    <br />
    What should this be?</p>

    <h3>Another Sub-Heading</h3>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading? Probably not. Too much info/text now.
right?</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<!-- add a few "breaks" here to create some space! 
 **hint** you can also use these to break sentences into new lines... 
 as it was intended to be used! try using one in the middle of a paragraph and see what
  happens in your browser-->

    <h3>And Another Sub-Heading</h3>
    <p>More headings?? Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now. Let's use a proper tag. 
</p>
    <h3>Yet Another Sub-Heading</h3>
    <p>That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. <br/>
    You know what to do now.  Make this <strong>WORD </strong>strong aka bold. Give it a proper tag!

<!-- add the proper tags to change "th" and "2" below -->
<p>Today is the 4<sup>th</sup> of July and there is a lot of C0<sub>2</sub> in the air.</p>

<!-- try using the "abbr" tag just like it's used in the book for the line below --> 

<p>In case you were wondering, here is <abbr Professior="Prof">Prof</abbr> John Doe's address!</p>
<br><br>
<!-- Make each line for the address appears on a new line, starting with the name -->
<p>John Doe</p>

<address> Fruitvale Ave
